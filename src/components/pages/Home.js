      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Matt, an aspiring Fullstack Developer. I graduated magna cum
        laude from the University of Colorado-Boulder in 2011 with a degree in
        Ecology and Evolutionary Biology with a teaching certificate in
        Secondary Science Education. I then worked as a wildland firefighter for
        the US Forest Service for nearly a decade, ultimately becoming a
        helicopter rappeler. This was a fun way to spend my twenties and taught
        me discipline, how to make decisions in high stress environments and
        manageing people. I am excited to start a new chapter in computer
        programming.
